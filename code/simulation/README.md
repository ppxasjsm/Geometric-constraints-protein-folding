# Running Simulations with Julia

If you do not have Julia installed follow [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyx8M1yoboY) instructions. 
The code was tested with Julia version 1.0 and 1.1 and is not supported for versions < 1.0.


The easiest way is to run these through a notebook, which you can start as:

```Julia
using IJulia
notebook()
```

Then simply open up the notebook called `FinalCode.ipynb` and follow the instructions inside it.
