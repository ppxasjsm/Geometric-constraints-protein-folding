abstract = {We model a disordered planar monolayer of paramagnetic spherical particles, or ferrofluid, as a two-dimensional fluid of hard spheres with embedded three-dimensional magnetic point dipoles. This model, in which the orientational degrees of freedom are three dimensional while particle positions are confined to a plane, can be taken as a crude representation of a colloidal suspension of superparamagnetic particles confined in a water/air interface, a system that has recently been studied experimentally. In this paper, we propose an Ornstein-Zernike integral equation approach capable of describing the structure of this highly inhomogeneous fluid, including the effects of an external magnetic field. The method hinges on the use of specially tailored orthogonal polynomials whose weight function is precisely the one-particle distribution function that describes the surface- and field-induced anisotropy. The results obtained for various particle densities and external fields are compared with Monte Carlo simulations, illustrating the capability of the inhomogeneous Ornstein-Zernike equation and the proposed solution scheme to yield a detailed and accurate description of the spatial and orientational structure for this class of systems. For comparison, results from density-functional theory in the modified mean-field approximation are also presented; this latter approach turns out to yield at least qualitatively correct results.},

@article{Bagler2007a,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Starting from linear chains of amino acids, the spontaneous folding of proteins into their elaborate 3D structures is one of the remarkable examples of biological self-organization. We investigated native state structures of 30 single-domain, two-state proteins, from complex networks perspective, to understand the role of topological parameters in proteins' folding kinetics, at two length scales--as 'Protein Contact Networks (PCNs)' and their corresponding 'Long-range Interaction Networks (LINs)' constructed by ignoring the short-range interactions. RESULTS: Our results show that, both PCNs and LINs exhibit the exceptional topological property of 'assortative mixing' that is absent in all other biological and technological networks studied so far. We show that the degree distribution of these contact networks is partly responsible for the observed assortativity. The coefficient of assortativity also shows a positive correlation with the rate of protein folding at both short- and long-contact scale, whereas, the clustering coefficients of only the LINs exhibit a negative correlation. The results indicate that the general topological parameters of these naturally evolved protein networks can effectively represent the structural and functional properties required for fast information transfer among the residues facilitating biochemical/kinetic functions, such as, allostery, stability and the rate of folding. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

All $\backslash$nlong alpha helices can be unambiguously characterized as belonging $\backslash$nto one of three classes: linear, curved, or kinked, with a majority $\backslash$nbeing curved. Analysis of the sequences of these helices reveals $\backslash$nthat the long alpha helices have unique sequence characteristics $\backslash$nthat distinguish them from the short alpha helices in globular proteins. $\backslash$nThe distribution and statistical propensities of individual amino $\backslash$nacids to occur in long alpha helices are different from those found $\backslash$nin short alpha helices, with amino acids having longer side chains $\backslash$nand/or having a greater number of functional groups occurring more $\backslash$nfrequently in these helices. The sequences of the long alpha helices $\backslash$ncan be correlated with their gross structural features, i.e., whether $\backslash$nthey are curved, linear, or kinked, and in case of the curved helices, $\backslash$nwith their curvature.},

abstract = {Many small proteins fold via a first-order ``all-or-none{\{}''{\}} transition directly from an expanded coil to a compact native state. Here we study an analogous direct freezing transition from an expanded coil to a compact crystallite for a simple flexible homopolymer. Wang-Landau sampling is used to construct the 1D density of states for square-well chains of length 128. Analysis within both the micro-canonical and canonical ensembles shows that, for a chain with sufficiently short-range interactions, the usual polymer collapse transition is preempted by a direct freezing or ``folding{\{}''{\}} transition. A 2D free-energy landscape, built via subsequent multi-canonical sampling, reveals a dominant folding pathway over a single free-energy barrier. This barrier separates a high entropy ensemble of unfolded states from a low entropy set of crystallite states and the transition proceeds via the formation of a transition-state folding nucleus. Despite the non-unique homopolymer ground state, the thermodynamics of this direct freezing transition are identical to the thermodynamics of two-state protein folding. The model chain satisfies the van't Hoff calorimetric criterion for two-state folding and an Arrhenius analysis of the folding/unfolding free energy barrier yields a Chevron plot characteristic of small proteins.

abstract = {Under physiological conditions, a protein undergoes a spontaneous disorder order transition called "folding." The protein polymer is highly flexible when unfolded but adopts its unique native, three-dimensional structure when folded. Current experimental knowledge comes primarily from thermodynamic measurements in solution or the structures of individual molecules, elucidated by either x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. From the former, we know the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy differences between the folded and unfolded forms of hundreds of proteins under a variety of solvent/cosolvent conditions. From the latter, we know the structures of approximately 35,000 proteins, which are built on scaffolds of hydrogen-bonded structural elements, alpha-helix and beta-sheet. Anfinsen showed that the amino acid sequence alone is sufficient to determine a protein's structure, but the molecular mechanism responsible for self-assembly remains an open question, probably the most fundamental open question in biochemistry. This perspective is a hybrid: partly review, partly proposal. First, we summarize key ideas regarding protein folding developed over the past half-century and culminating in the current mindset. In this view, the energetics of side-chain interactions dominate the folding process, driving the chain to self-organize under folding conditions. Next, having taken stock, we propose an alternative model that inverts the prevailing side-chain/backbone paradigm. Here, the energetics of backbone hydrogen bonds dominate the folding process, with preorganization in the unfolded state. Then, under folding conditions, the resultant fold is selected from a limited repertoire of structural possibilities, each corresponding to a distinct hydrogen-bonded arrangement of alpha-helices and/or strands of beta-sheet.},

Here we address the question of whether this feature of proteins is a rare property selected by evolution or whether it is in fact true of a significant proportion of all possible protein sequences. Using statistical procedures developed to study spin glasses, we show that, given certain assumptions, the probability that a randomly synthesized protein chain will have a dominant fold (which is the global minimum of free energy) is a function of temperature, and that below a critical temperature the probability rapidly increases as the temperature decreases. Our results suggest that a significant proportion of all possible protein sequences could have a thermodynamically dominant fold.},

According to Flory's theory, a power law between radius of gyration and the length of homopolymer chain is found, with exponent 3/5 for good solvent and 1/3 for poor solvent. For protein in physiological condition, a solvent condition in between, a power law with exponent {\~{}}2/5 is obtained. In this paper, we present a unified formula to cover all above cases. It shows that the scaling exponents are generally correlated with fractal dimension of a chain under certain solvent condition. While applying our formula to protein, the fractal dimension is found to depend on its hydrophobicity. By turning a physical process-varying hydrophobicity of a chain by amino acid mutation, to an equivalent chemical process-varying polarity of solvent by adding polar or nonpolar molecules, we successfully deprive this relation, with reasonable agreement to statistical data. And it will be helpful for protein structure prediction. Our results indicate that the protein may share the same basic principle with homopolymer, despite its specificity as a heteropolymer.},

By adopting this representation it was possible to compute the average clustering coefficient (C) and characteristic path length (L) of protein structures, and their values were found to be similar to those of graphs characterized by small-world topology. In this comment, we analyze a large set of non-redundant protein structures (1753) and show that by randomly mimicking the protein collapse, the covalent structure of the protein chain significantly contributes to the small-world behavior of the inter-residue contact graphs. When protein graphs are generated, imposing constraints similar to those induced by the backbone connectivity, their characteristic path lengths and clustering coefficients are indistinguishable from those computed using the real contact maps showing that L and C values cannot be used for 'protein fingerprinting'. Moreover we verified that these results are independent of the selected protein representations, residue composition and protein secondary structures.},

abstract = {For proteins that fold by two-state kinetics, the folding and unfolding processes are believed to be closely related to their native structures. In particular, folding and unfolding rates are influenced by the native structures of proteins. Thus, we focus on finding important topological quantities from a protein structure that determine its unfolding rate. After constructing graphs from protein native structures, we investigate the relationships between unfolding rates and various topological quantities of the graphs. First, we find that the correlation between the unfolding rate and the contact order is not as prominent as in the case of the folding rate and the contact order. Next, we investigate the correlation between the unfolding rate and the clustering coefficient of the graph of a protein native structure, and observe no correlation between them. Finally, we find that a newly introduced quantity, the impact of edge removal per residue, has a good overall correlation with protein unfolding rates. The impact of edge removal is defined as the ratio of the change of the average path length to the edge removal probability. From these facts, we conclude that the protein unfolding process is closely related to the protein native structure.},

A simplified Go-like model is proposed and solved exactly. The predicted critical behavior is verified via exact numerical enumeration of a large ensemble of similarly designed sequences.},

This book explains the basic theory for the graduate while also reaching into the specialized fields of disordered systems and renormalization groups. Readers are expected to be able to handle some fundamental mathematical procedures, such as integration and differentiation of single variable functions, probability and statistics. Computer programming experience in Fortran is also useful. While percolation is treated as a fundamentally physical concept, its relevance to various natural and living systems is addressed. Much of the book deals with systems lying close to the critical point phase transition point, where the subject is at its most interesting and sensitive. This book should be of value to all those who deal with systems which exhibit critical points and phase transition behavior.},

Here we show that the temperature dependence of the folding of protein L becomes extremely simple when the effects of temperature on protein stability are corrected for; the logarithm of the folding rate is a linear function of 1/T on constant stability contours in the temperature-denaturant plane. This convincingly demonstrates that the anomalous temperature dependence of folding derives from the temperature dependence of the interactions that stabilize proteins, rather than from the super Arrhenius temperature dependence predicted for the configurational diffusion constant on a rough energy landscape. However, because of the limited temperature range accessible to experiment, the results do not rule out models with higher order temperature dependences. The significance of the slope of the stability-corrected Arrhenius plots is discussed.},

We discuss here the theoretical underpinnings and history of coarse-graining and summarize the state of the field, organizing key methodologies based on an emerging paradigm for multiscale theory and modeling of biomolecular systems. This framework involves an integrated, iterative approach to couple information from different scales. The primary steps, which coincide with key areas of method development, include developing first-pass coarse-grained models guided by experimental results, performing numerous large-scale coarse-grained simulations, identifying important interactions that drive emergent behaviors, and finally reconnecting to the molecular scale by performing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations guided by the coarse-grained results. The coarse-grained modeling can then be extended and refined, with the entire loop repeated iteratively if necessary.},

Current mathematical methods for epidemiological forecasting on networks largely assume that contacts between individuals are fixed, at least for the duration of an outbreak. In reality, contact patterns may be quite fluid, with individuals frequently making and breaking social or sexual relationships. Here, we develop a mathematical approach to predicting disease transmission on dynamic networks in which each individual has a characteristic behaviour (typical contact number), but the identities of their contacts change in time. We show that dynamic contact patterns shape epidemiological dynamics in ways that cannot be adequately captured in static network models or mass-action models. Our new model interpolates smoothly between static network models and mass-action models using a mixing parameter, thereby providing a bridge between disparate classes of epidemiological models. Using epidemiological and sexual contact data from an Atlanta high school, we demonstrate the application of this method for forecasting and controlling sexually transmitted disease outbreaks.},

In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph.},

Characterizing the geometrical properties of these networks has become increasingly relevant for routing problems, inference and data mining. In real growing networks, topological, structural and geometrical properties emerge spontaneously from their dynamical rules. Nevertheless we still miss a model in which networks develop an emergent complex geometry. Here we show that a single two parameter network model, the growing geometrical network, can generate complex network geometries with non-trivial distribution of curvatures, combining exponential growth and small-world properties with finite spectral dimensionality. In one limit, the non-equilibrium dynamical rules of these networks can generate scale-free networks with clustering and communities, in another limit planar random geometries with non-trivial modularity. Finally we find that these properties of the geometrical growing networks are present in a large set of real networks describing biological, social and technological systems.},

abstract = {An outstanding challenge in the field of molecular biology has been to understand the process by which proteins fold into their characteristic three-dimensional structures. Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 $\mu$s and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.},

The speed of convergence towards synchrony provides a fundamental collective time scale for synchronizing systems. Here we study the asymptotic synchronization times for directed networks with topologies ranging from completely ordered, grid-like, to completely disordered, random, including intermediate, partially disordered topologies. We extend the approach of Master Stability Functions to quantify synchronization times. We find that the synchronization times strongly and systematically depend on the network topology. In particular, at fixed in-degree, stronger topological randomness induces faster synchronization, whereas at fixed path length, synchronization is slowest for intermediate randomness in the small-world regime. Randomly rewiring real-world neural, social and transport networks confirms this picture.},

abstract = {Sociologists often model social processes as interactions among vari- ables.We review an alternative approach that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) showhowsimple and predictable local interactions can generate familiarbut enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoun- dations at the relational level.We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from “factors” to “actors” in computational sociology that shows howagent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation.We then reviewrecent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social or- der out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this newmethodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural fac- tors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological potential of this approach.},

How the network of interactions dynamically self-organizes in such systems is far from fully understood. Here, we analyze a class of spatial network formation processes by introducing a mapping from geometric to graph-theoretic constraints. Combining stochastic and mean field analyses yields an algebraic scaling law for the extent (graph diameter) of the resulting networks with system size, in contrast to logarithmic scaling known for networks without constraints. Intriguingly, the exponent falls between that of self-avoiding random walks and that of space filling arrangements, consistent with experimentally observed scaling (of the spatial radius of gyration) for protein tertiary structures.},

abstract = {We report the experimental observation of vortex patterns in vertically vibrated granular rods. Above a critical packing fraction, moving ordered domains of nearly vertical rods spontaneously form and coexist with horizontal rods. The domains of vertical rods coarsen in time to form large vortices. We investigate the conditions under which the vortices occur by varying the number of rods, vibration amplitude, and frequency. The size of the vortices increases with the number of rods. We characterize the growth of the ordered domains by measuring the area fraction of the ordered regions as a function of time. A void-filling model is presented to describe the nucleation and growth of the vertical domains. We track the ends of the vertical rods and obtain the velocity fields of the vortices. The rotation speed of the rods is observed to depend on the vibration velocity of the container and on the packing. To investigate the impact of the direction of driving on the observed phenomena, we performed experiments with the container vibrated horizontally. Although vertical domains form, vortices are not observed. We therefore argue that the motion is generated due to the interaction of the inclination of the rods with the bottom of a vertically vibrated container. We also perform simple experiments with a single row of rods in an annulus. These experiments directly demonstrate that the rod motion is generated when the rods are inclined from the vertical, and is always in the direction of the inclination.},

The polymers are 27 monomers long and consist of two monomer types. Although these chains are too long for exhaustive enumeration of all conformations, it is possible to enumerate all the maximally compact conformations, which are 3x3x3 cubes. This allows us to select sequences that have a unique global minimum. We then explore the kinetics of collapse and folding and examine what features determine the various rates. The folding time has a plateau over a broad range of temperatures and diverges at both high and low temperatures. The folding time depends on sequence and is related to the amount of energetic frustration in the native state. The collapse times of the chains are sequence independent and are a few orders of magnitude faster than the folding times, indicating a two-phase folding process. Below a certain temperature the chains exhibit glass-like behavior, characterized by a slowing down of time scales and loss of self-averaging behavior. We explicitly define the glass transition temperature (Tg), and by comparing it to the folding temperature (Tf), we find two classes of sequences: good folders with Tf {\textgreater} Tg and non-folders with Tf {\textless} Tg.},

Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks.

abstract = {We demonstrate in this work that the surface tension, water-organic solvent, transfer-free energies and the thermodynamics of melting of linear alkanes provide fundamental insights into the nonpolar driving forces for protein folding and protein binding reactions. We first develop a model for the curvature dependence of the hydrophobic effect and find that the macroscopic concept of interfacial free energy is applicable at the molecular level. Application of a well-known relationship involving surface tension and adhesion energies reveals that dispersion forces play little or no net role in hydrophobic interactions; rather, the standard model of disruption of water structure (entropically driven at 25 degrees C) is correct. The hydrophobic interaction is found, in agreement with the classical picture, to provide a major driving force for protein folding. Analysis of the melting behavior of hydrocarbons reveals that close packing of the protein interior makes only a small free energy contribution to folding because the enthalpic gain resulting from increased dispersion interactions (relative to the liquid) is countered by the freezing of side chain motion. The identical effect should occur in association reactions, which may provide an enormous simplification in the evaluation of binding energies. Protein binding reactions, even between nearly planar or concave/convex interfaces, are found to have effective hydrophobicities considerably smaller than the prediction based on macroscopic surface tension. This is due to the formation of a concave collar region that usually accompanies complex formation. This effect may preclude the formation of complexes between convex surfaces.},

abstract = {We consider the dynamical scaling of a single polymer chain in good solvent. In the case of two-dimensional systems, Shannon and Choy [Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 1455 (1997)] have suggested that the dynamical scaling for a dilute polymer solution breaks down. Using scaling arguments and analytical calculations based on the Zimm model, we show that the dynamical scaling of a dilute two-dimensional polymer system holds when the relevant dynamical quantities are properly extracted from finite systems. Most important, the polymer diffusion coefficient in two dimensions scales logarithmically with system size, in excellent agreement with our extensive computer simulations. This scaling is the reason for the failure of the previous attempts to resolve the dynamical scaling of dilute two-dimensional polymer systems. In three and higher dimensions our analytic calculations are in agreement with previous results in the literature.},
